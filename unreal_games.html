        <h2>Breakout</h2>
        <br><p>I first realized a Breakout clone with one teammate. The game is fairly simple: you have 3 balls (here called lives) and you have to destroy all the bricks. 
          Some bricks take multiple hits to be destroyed and change color to show how many hits are remaining before destruction. The game is playable with a controller.

        <h2>Bomberman</h2>
        <br><p>Then we created a Bomberman clone in a team of 3. The game features local multiplayer, spawning as many players as there are controllers connected to the computer. 
          Some power-ups are available in game and drop from destroyed blocks: the pink one gives an extra life to the player to survive multiple explisions and the blue one extends the range of the next bomb explosion.
          The bombs are animated to "pulse" before exploding using Timelines feature in Unreal Engine.
