        <h2>Bonnote: Website with SQL database</h2>
        <br><p>This is a website I have realized with two classmates (you'll see that some parts of the website disposition like the header were reused for this portfolio). 
          This website has a fairly simple interface, as the focus of this project was mainly to use PHP queries to manipulate data from a SQL database, hosted locally by UwAmp and managed with MySQL.
          You can access the website archive by clicking the button at the end of this page: this version of the website is not connected to the database anymore, but you can still navigate through the pages. 
          You can also see the files on my GitHub in which the original PHP scripts are still present.

        <br><p>This is the page to sign up to the website. The data entered by the user was then sent to the SQL database with a PHP script and stored for later use.</p>

        <h2>Offers</h2>
        <br><p>The concept of the website is parodic, imagining a website where students could simply pay to raise their notes in a given subject.
          This page shows the offers available to the user. Once the user has subscribed to an offer, the website would then update the user's record in the database.
          The user can then connect himself to the website and see which offers he has subscribed to.
