        <h2>Lights Out</h2>
        <br><p>This game (powered by Pygame for Python) was an interesting way to put in practice different concepts of linear algebra seen during my studies. 
          The goal is to turn off all the yellow lights on the grid by clicking them: clicking a light changes its status and those of all the surrounding lights in a cross shape.
          You can play on 3x3, 4x4 and 5x5 grids to change the level of difficulty.

        <h2>Displaying the solution</h2>
        <br><p>If at any given point you're having trouble solving the grid, you can toggle on and off the solution to see which lights need to be pressed. </p>

        <h2>Resolving the grid</h2>
        <br><p>The grid is completed when all the lights have been turned off. When you have finished, you can simply start a new random game by selecting a grid size of quit the app.</p>

        <h2>Increasing the difficulty</h2>
        <br><p>Once the player is comfortable on 3x3 and 4x4 grids, they can try beating 5x5 grids which are a little more difficult to complete. 
          You can try the game yourself following the link below.
